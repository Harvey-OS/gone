0. Add harvey to the list of OSes it can deal with
0.5 Find where runtime checks for the string Plan 9 and check for harvey too.
0.6 but it can not be automated. Let's get /dev/urandom and avoid the bullshit we're seeing in places
1. For all non-z* files that are *plan9.go, copy to *harvey.go
2. For all build constraints in *harvey.go that are plan 9, change to harvey
3. For all *Plan9.s, instead use the corresponding linux files.
4. Find all other files that depend on plan 9, and add harvey
5. Figure out how to generate files for z*.go
